# React Fundamentals Trainer

## Instructions

  - Fork this project using the button in the Sandbox Editor header.
  - Open the "Project Info" tab from the left side panel, and add your name to the Project Title
    - e.g., "React Fundamentals Trainer: Ignatius Riley"
  - Write components that will make all the tests pass (Tests run in a panel at the bottom of the screen.)
  - Post the URL of your completed project to the spreadsheet on our Slack team.  

## Learning Objectives
  - Demonstrate understanding of JSX 
  - Demonstrate understanding of React component modularity
  - Demonstrate understanding of a React component's props
  - Demonstrate understanding of a React component's state
  - Demonstrate understanding of event handling in React
  - Begin exploring a very important question: 
    *Which part of your application should "own" state?*
 
## Requirements

The small app you will create here will display a list of names. Clicking
on a name in that list will add that individual to a list of invited 
guests. Invited guests should be rendered in another component that sits 
on top of the list of friends. 

A gif is included at the root of this project at './guest-list.gif', for 
a visual demonstration. 

Your task is to write two components that will comprise this feature: 
  - GuestList
  - Friend

Empty modules have been prepared for you to create these components in. 

## Test Running & Styles

Each component is paired with a test suite (e.g. Friend.jsx is paired 
with Friend.test.jsx). Tests will be re-run with after every save event,
and can be viewed in the console below. 

**Note: Your work is satisfactory if and only if you make the tests pass**

You'll want to read the tests carefully as you write your code. You may also
want to peruse './src/styles.css', so that you assign the right class names
to mimic the appearance of the gif, but this isn't necessary. 

Good luck!
